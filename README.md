# Attendance-Management-System
The objectives of developing Student Attendance Management System are identified based on the review of the problem statements. The purposes are listed as below:
I.	To store, access and manage student attendance data for every lecture and lab classes.
 All the student attendance data will be stored and managed through Student Attendance Management System. This system enables lecturer to add, view, make changes or delete on subjects, classes, students and attendance accordingly. Moreover, saving attendance records into the system will be more secured as compared to paper-based records.
II.	To automatically calculate number of absences and the percentage of present of the students based on subjects with respective lecture and lab classes.
 Student Attendance Management System enhances calculation process to be more accurate and fast. This system by default will do the analysis, which are counting the number of absences and calculate the percentage of present of all the students based on the input data. Hence, the calculated value can be ascertained and trusted as the calculation process is developed to run automatically within the system.

# Scope of Project

Scope that involved in  Attendance Management System is divided into two parts, which are involvement of user and types of module. The scope is described as below: 
1.	User:
Lecturer is the main user for Student Attendance Management System. Lecturer can use the system to record and manage student daily attendance for all the classes. The system enables lecturer to mark students attendance and can also update it.
2.	Module: 
Modules that are included in Student Attendance Management System are listed as below:
 
•	Login module 
This module helps authenticate the validity and eligibility of the lecturer before he or she can use the system. Lecturer is required to login using username and password. If either username or password is inserted wrongly, the system will prompt out login error message. This is important to protect the confidentiality of the attendance data and to prevent unauthorized user from using, accessing and manipulating the system. 
   	


•	Student module 
This module provides convenience in managing student details. Admin can add students into the attendance one by one. Student data will be deleted when the student does not belong to any of the classes. Attendance module 
This module allows lecturer to manage and alter the attendance data efficiently. Lecturer adds new attendance on daily basis. This module by default assigns all the students to be present as the number of student who present will be more than absent. Then, lecturer can manipulate and change the absentees. 


•	Calculation module 
This module provides student with accurate value about the consistency of attending the class session. This module by default will add up the number of attendance once new attendance information is added. From the attendance data, the attendance status will be grouped and categorized accordingly. After that, the calculation process that involved is total up the absent status of the absentees and converts the number of present status into percentage based on subject. Hence, student is able to view and read the calculated value without counting it manually.
